This is the most relaxed part of the website, where I talk a little bit about myself and about my interests outside work.

I was born and raised in Madrid where, as many boys of my generation, dreamt to be a football player for the Real Madrid FC. At the age of 11 I started to develop interest in music and decided to hang my boots. Music kept me busy for about the next 11 years, between clarinet classes, music theory, music language, harmony, musical analysis... 

At the age of 16 the lifeguard of the community swimming pool spent an entire summer convincing me to go and try water polo in September when the new term starts. I went to the first training and next day I had to use an office wheelchair we had in the house to go down the corridor from my room to the kitchen. Nevertheless, I kept going until I reached uni. 

What I’ve taken from uni is my like for libraries. The number of hours I spent in them during the 6-year degree I study made them feel like a second home now. But that wasn’t all I did in my uni days. After I graduated from the music professional conservatoire my life felt empty with so much free time, so I decided to join a music association at uni and later a federated swimming club.

After graduating in Meng Civil Engineering, I came to the UK in search of great professional opportunities and succeeded by finding AECOM.

It won’t come as a surprise to you if I tell you that music and swimming/water polo are two of my passions outside work nowadays. Currently I play for [Kempston concert band](http://www.kempstonconcertband.org/index.html) where we prepare repertoire for three  charity concerts a year. I get my chlorine dose by playing water polo for [Bedford water polo club](http://www.bwpc.co.uk/index.html) and swimming with the Trinity Arts & Leisure Master’s swimmers.

Other interests that I have are psychology, human behaviour or philosophy. I’m far from having any significant knowledge on any of these areas but more often than not I gravitate towards them by choosing to watch a documentary related to them, reading a particular book or listening to a podcast.

Unwinding, exploring, stretching your views, meeting new people, learning about history and culture, enjoying amazing food and drinks. It’s difficult not to like a good trip. Milan, Athens, Rome, Vienna, Paris, Dublin, Amalfi, York, Costa Rica, Venice, Lyon, Cologne, Warsaw, Berlin, Copenhagen and Florence are some of the places I’ve been to in the past few years. I’ve loved each of those trips and I look forward those trips still to come.
