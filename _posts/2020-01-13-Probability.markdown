You finished your degree you started a job and a few years later a colleague casually asks you - If I had 7 cars with their 7 keys and I randomly distributed one key per car, what's the probability that at least one of the keys belongs to the car it was given?

You take out your notebook, search the web for answers, try different calcs on a spreadsheet and soon realize that all you used to know about probability and statistics is now nothing but a dim memory. Luckily for you, you found this website where you'll be able to refresh those neurons paths and remember how good a statistician you are.
