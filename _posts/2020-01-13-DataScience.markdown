Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. In this post I link several personal projects I've worked on where I apply data science techniques and methodologies, from EDA (explanatory data analysis) to forecasting machine learning models.

### GB Accidents 2005-2015 - Case of study.

This case of study is an opportunity to learn and see how every day data science tasks are performed, while learning interesting key points about GB's road accidents between 2005 and 2015.

### Football Score predictor
One of the "hello world" of many data scientist into machine learning
is a score predictor machine, being it for tennis, football or any other sport.
It's appealing because there's a lot of data available, because it can
be used for betting and because sports are fun.

### Fetching data

To be able to evaluate a company's fundamentals we need some key information such as the balance-sheet, the cash-flow records, and the income statements. The next Jupiter notebooks will show you how to get this data using two different methodologies. Web scraping and API requests. It must be noted that the second methodology is more robust and not susceptible to web layout changes.
