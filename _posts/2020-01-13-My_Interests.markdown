I was born and raised in Madrid where, as many boys of my generation, dreamt to be a football player for the Real Madrid FC. At the age of 11 I started to develop interest in music and decided to hang my boots. Music kept me busy for about the next 11 years, while I attended lessons on clarinet, music theory, music language, harmony, music analysis... 

At the age of 16 the lifeguard of the community swimming pool spent an entire summer convincing me to go and try water polo in September when the new term started. Naively, I went to the first training session and almost didn't make it. The next day my body ached so much that I had to use an office wheelchair to go down the corridor from my room to the kitchen. Naturally, I kept going until I had to take a break when I started university. 

After I graduated from the music professional conservatory on the 4th year of my MEng degree, my life felt empty with so much free time. I decided to join a music association at university and joined a federated swimming club.

I graduated in Meng Civil Engineering in June 2015. By November that year I came to the UK in search of professional opportunities. Working in warehouses and retail shops wasn't exactly what I had in mind butafter 6 months landed a job in Bedford working for AECOM.

Bedford might not have the broadest activities menu but there's still a lot do if you are proactive. During my time there I played for [Kempston concert band](http://www.kempstonconcertband.org/index.html) where we prepared repertoire for three charity concerts a year, played water polo for [Bedford water polo club](http://www.bwpc.co.uk/index.html), swam with the Trinity Arts & Leisure Master’s swimmers and even took a small part in a theatre performance.

Five years and one pandemic later I decided to take an opportunity to work for a small company in Leeds, Citi Logik. The high demands of my job have forced me to cut back on some of my activities but Leeds is a great lively city that I'm enjoying to live in.

I have an endless curiosity about the world that I try to tame by focusing on understanding how things work. I try to keep learning by reading, listening and enrolling in online courses. The areas that I'm developing a deeper understanding in are data science, business, economics, finance, and health optimisation.

Unwinding, exploring, stretching your views, meeting new people, learning about history and culture or enjoying amazing food and drinks. It’s difficult not to like a good trip. Milan, Athens, Rome, Vienna, Paris, Dublin, Amalfi, York, Costa Rica, Venice, Lyon, Cologne, Warsaw, Berlin, Copenhagen and Florence are some of the places I’ve been to in the past few years. I’ve loved each and every one of those trips and I look forward trips still to come.
