This post sumuraises some of the interesting projects I've carried out and tools I've developed providing links to jupyter notebook markdowns where you'll be able look code used and results obtained in more detail. Some of projects are personal and therefore not subject to any property rights. Some of the tools have been developed for AECOM and therefore the code cannot be diclosure but it's still interesting to see their functionality.
