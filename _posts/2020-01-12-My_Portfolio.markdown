This post summarises some of the projects I've carried out and tools I've developed. In both cases it provides links to Jupyter notebooks where you'll be able to look at the code used, and results obtained in detail.


### GB Accidents 2005-2015 - Case of study.

This case of study is an opportunity to learn and see how every day data science tasks are performed, while learning interesting key points about GB's road accidents between 2005 and 2015.

### Football Score predictor
One of the "hello worlds" of many data scientist into machine learning
is a score predictor machine, being it for tennis, football or any other sport.
It's appealing because there's a lot of data available, because it can
be used for betting and because sports are fun.
